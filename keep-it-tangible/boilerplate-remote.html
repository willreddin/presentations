# Make things Tangible!

---
class: center, middle

# Introduction

- Hi I’m Will Reddin
- D.M at dxw and before that worked with GDS
- As a D.M I’m always looking for ways to make things more
  - Transparent 
  - Inspectable

So the team can Adapt!

# One of the key features in agile teams is the wall board/ information radiator
(what ever you want to call it)

---
class: center, middle

These take many forms: 
  - from Simple To do, doing done
  - To really complex Kanban process flows
  - I’ve seen both types work well

#Don’t be too tempted to use software to fill the gap - keep them as a physical thing whenever possible

---

class: center, middle

# Why software? The lure of capturing everything

---

class: center, middle

# Good for:
  - Keeping track of large amounts of info (A) - large pivotal board (like the one at TVH)
  - Which means big fancy reports (Ex - Velocity, Burndown, Estimates) 
  - Really good for distributed teams (Yeah no doubt about that)

---

# Okay great but…

---
class: center, middle

- Keeping track of everything =/= increased Productivity
- Trap of analysis paralysis
- Good indicators/ be not necessarily effective motivators (A) 
- We can always find reasons to doubt the stats! - Down a person, task A not like task B

#So what advantages are there for keeping things in physical spaces for teams?

---

class: center, middle

# 1 Real objects help memory

---
class: center, middle

- Important for the team to have roughly the same knowledge in their heads
- Compare a project on pivotal to project on the board. I find it hard to visualise (more uniform) the other is made of real tangible things
- Visualisation is easier when it is a real thing:
  - Has context, occupies space
  - Like remembering a pack of cards, locus method
  - Agile teams focus on real tangible things (show and tells) over extensive documentation for this reason
  - (A) - Project at dxw we have pivotal for communication, but still stand-up around the physical board

# 2 The satisfaction of getting a real thing into the DONE column/pile/bunting

---
class: center, middle

- Don’t underestimate the importance of showing team accomplishments everyday! Out in the open!
- (A) - GDS done bunting! too many dones -> done bunting!
- (O) - More joy than clicking a button! Harder to miss too!

#Some things I like to follow when designing/ creating Visual information things

---
class: center, middle

- Don’t overthink at the start, or more importantly: expect things to change.
  - (A) It’s part of the agenda for our teams retro at dxw, did it work? -> iterate (A) changing from simple review process to a more complex chanson esq flow. 
- Keep visual info as simple as you can
  - peoples brains work in different ways (some more visual than others) (A) some people don’t like lots of colours, others don’t want lots of lists

#So keep it visible/tangible/memorable!

Any Qs?

---

class: center, middle

#Can we take this idea further?
